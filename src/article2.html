        <p>
          Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves
          and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation
          process used to make oolong teas and black teas.[1] Green tea
          originated in China, but its production and manufacture has spread to
          other countries in East Asia.

        <p>
          Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based
          on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural
          methods, production processing, and time of harvest. Although there
          has been considerable research on the possible health effects of
          consuming green tea regularly, there is little evidence that drinking
          green tea has any effects on health.[2]
