        <p>
          White tea may refer to one of several styles of tea which generally
          feature young or minimally processed leaves of the Camellia sinensis
          plant. Currently there is no generally accepted definition of white
          tea and very little international agreement; some sources use the term
          to refer to tea that is merely dried with no additional processing,
          some to tea made from the buds and immature tea leaves picked shortly
          before the buds have fully opened and allowed to wither and dry in
          natural sun,[citation needed] while others include tea buds and very
          young leaves which have been steamed or fired before drying. Most
          definitions agree, however, that white tea is not rolled or oxidized,
          resulting in a flavour characterized as "lighter" than most green or
          traditional black teas.

          In spite of its name, brewed white tea is pale yellow. Its name
          derives from the fine silvery-white hairs on the unopened buds of the
          tea plant, which give the plant a whitish appearance. The unopened
          buds are used for some types of white tea. It is harvested primarily
          in China, mostly in the Fujian province, but more recently produced in
          Eastern Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, Galle (Southern Sri Lanka) and
          northeast India.
