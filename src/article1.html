        <p>
          Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green,
          and white teas. Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than other
          teas. All four types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree)
          Camellia sinensis. Two principal varieties of the species are used â
          the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis var. sinensis),
          used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant
          (C. sinensis var. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for
          black tea, although in recent years some green and white teas have
          been produced. In China, where black tea was discovered, the beverage
          is called "red tea" due to the color of the oxidized leaves when
          processed appropriately.

          While green tea usually loses its flavor within a year, black tea
          retains its flavor for several years. For this reason, it has long
          been an article of trade, and compressed bricks of black tea even
          served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia, Tibet and Siberia
          into the 19th century. Black tea accounts for over 90% of all tea sold
          in the West
